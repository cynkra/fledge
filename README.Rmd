{fledge} has been designed to streamline the process of versioning R packages on _Git_, with the functionality to automatically update `NEWS.md` and `DESCRIPTION` with relevant information from recent commit messages.
Numbers are cheap, why not use them?

For details on usage and implementation, refer to `vignette("fledge")`.

## Installation

Install from GitHub using

```r
devtools::install_github("cynkra/fledge")
```

## Usage

Run {fledge} commands from your package directory for versioning as below.

* To configure your package for the first-time with {fledge}, use

    ```r
    fledge::bump_version()
    fledge::finalize_version()
    ```

    From now on, use bullet points (`*` or `-`) in your commit or merge messages to indicate the messages that you want to include in NEWS.md

* To assign a new `"dev"` version number to the R package and update `NEWS.md`, use

    ```r
    fledge::bump_version()
    fledge::finalize_version()
    ```

* To assign a new version number to the R package before release to CRAN, use

    ```r
    fledge::bump_version("patch")
    fledge::commit_version()
    ```

    Substitute `"patch"` by `"minor"` or `"major"` if applicable.

* To tag a version when the package has been accepted to CRAN, use

    ```r
    fledge::tag_version()
    ```
    
    Call 
    
    ```r
    fledge::bump_version()
    ```
    
    to immediately switch to a development version.

* To undo the last version bump, use

    ```r
    fledge::unbump_version()
    ```
