# fledge 0.0.4

## Features

- Prepend NEWS comment to discourage edits.
- Dates are added to NEWS headers if existing headers have them, or for a new NEWS file (#29).
- `finalize_version()` gains `push` argument which pushes the tag and the main branch, this considerably simplifies the workflow. It calls `edit_news()` and sends `finalize_version(push = TRUE)` to the RStudio or VS Code console.
- `tag_version()` returns name of created tag, invisibly.
- `tag_version(force = FALSE)` re-tags an existing tag if it points to the same commit.

## Bug fixes

- `bump_version()` gives correct advice if no remote branch exists.
- `bump_version()` and `get_top_level_commits()` are more robust at enumerating the commits: traversing the first parent from which `since` can be reached, instead of the first parent. This ensures that NEWS are more meaningful and avoids the occasional enumeration of all NEWS items since the beginning.

## Internal

Change log management utility, initial release.

The main entry point is `bump_version()`, which does the following:

1.  `update_news()`: collects `NEWS` entries from top-level commits
2.  `update_version()`: bump version in `DESCRIPTION`, add header to `NEWS.md`
3.  Depending on the kind of update:
    - If "dev", `finalize_version()`: commit `DESCRIPTION` and `NEWS.md`, create tag with message
    - Otherwise, `commit_version()`; the user needs to call `tag_version()` manually

If you haven't committed since updating `NEWS.md` and `DESCRIPTION`, you can also edit `NEWS.md` and call `tag_version()` again.
Both the commit and the tag will be updated.

Bumping can be undone with `unbump_version()`.

If the `DESCRIPTION` has a `"Date"` field, it is populated with the current date in `update_version()`.

An empty list of changes adds a "Same as previous version" bullet.
This allows bumping to a dev version immediately after CRAN release.

Also includes helper functions `get_last_tag()` and `get_top_level_commits()`.
