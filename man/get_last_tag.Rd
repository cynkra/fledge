\title{The most recent tag}
\usage{
get_last_tag()
}
\value{
A one-row tibble with columns \code{name}, \code{ref} and \code{commit}.
For annotated tags (as created by fledge), \code{commit} may be different
from the SHA of the commit that this tag points to.
Use \code{\link[gert:git_commit]{gert::git_log()}} to find the actual commit.
}
\description{
Returns the most recent Git tag that is reachable from the current branch.
This will not be accurate if the version bump and tag has occurred on a branch
which has been squashed into the main branch.
