Do you want to provide a changelog ([NEWS.md](https://blog.r-hub.io/2020/05/08/pkg-news/#why-write-the-changelog-as-newsmd)) more informative than ["bug fixes and performance improvements"](https://twitter.com/EmilyKager/status/1413628436984188933) to the users of your package?

Ways to achieve that are:

- Update NEWS.md right before release by reading through commit messages. Not necessarily fun!

- Update the changelog in every commit e.g. in every PR. Now, if there are several feature PRs around that update the changelog, you'll have a few clicks to make to tackle conflicts. Easy enough, but potentially annoying.

- Use fledge! fledge
    * fills the `NEWS.md` for you based on informative commit messages,
    * increases the version number in `DESCRIPTION` (e.g. useful in bug reports with session information!),
    * creates git tags (more coarse-grained history compared to top-level merges see [fledge tag list on GitHub](https://github.com/cynkra/fledge/tags)).

Using fledge is a discipline / a few habits that is worth learning!
