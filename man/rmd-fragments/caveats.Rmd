* If you **rebase after creating a tag**, you need to call `finalize_version()` to make sure the tag is moved to the mainline branch.

* If you **pushed after calling `finalize_version()` (directly or indirectly)**, the tag may have been pushed as well. In this case, invoke

```sh
git push origin :vx.y.z.9www
```

(where `x.y.z.9www` is the new version) to delete the newly created remote tag.
This is the reason why {fledge} only tags `"dev"` releases automatically.
Other releases always must be tagged manually with `tag_version()`.
