### Once per machine

Install from cynkra's R-universe using:

```r
install.packages("fledge", repos = "https://cynkra.r-universe.dev")
```

Or install from GitHub using:

```r
devtools::install_github("cynkra/fledge")
```

If you are used to making workflow packages (e.g. [devtools](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/usethis-setup.html#use-usethis-or-devtools-in-interactive-work)) available for all your interactive work, 
you might enjoy loading fledge in your [.Rprofile](https://rstats.wtf/r-startup.html#rprofile).

### Once per package

* Your package needs to have a remote that indicates the default branch (e.g. GitHub remote) _or_ to be using the same default branch name as your global/project `init.defaultbranch`.

* If your package...

   * is brand-new, remember to run `fledge::bump_version()` regularly.
   * has already undergone some development, not too late to jump on the train! Run `fledge::bump_version()` and then `fledge::finalize_version()`.
   
* Add a mention of fledge usage in your contributing guide, as contributors might not know about it.
