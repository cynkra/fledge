What you need to do in practice is:

- For important commit messages you want recorded in the changelog, you can

    - Use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) syntax. For instance `feat: Enhanced support for time series`. Only using conventional commits syntax will provide automatic *grouping* of changelog items into groups (Documentation, Bug Fixes, etc.).

     - Add a hyphen `-` or `*` at the beginning of the commit message.  Exclude housekeeping parts of the message by typing them after a line `---`.
    
    ```text
    
    - Add support for bla databases.
    
    ```
    
    or 
    
    ```text
    
    - Add support for bla databases.

    Also tweak the CI workflow accordingly. :sweat_smile:
    
    ```
    
    - Use informative merge commit messages as those will also be included by default in the changelog. On GitHub you can [control the default commit message when merging a pull request](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-23-new-options-for-controlling-the-default-commit-message-when-merging-a-pull-request/).
    
    - (GitHub repositories only) For merge commits with the default not self-contained message ("Merge pull request..."), rely on fledge's querying GitHub API to get the PR title and include it in the changelog.

For informative commit messages refer to the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html).

- Run `fledge::bump_version()` regularly e.g. before every coffee break or at the end of the day or of the week. If you forgot to merge one PR run `fledge::unbump_version()`, merge the PR with an informative squash commit message, then run `fledge::bump_version()` and go drink that coffee!

- Run `fledge::finalize_version()` if you need to edit `NEWS.md` manually e.g. if you made a typo or are not happy with a phrasing in retrospect. Even if you edit a lot, what's been written in by fledge is still a good place-holder.

- Follow the recommended steps at release (see `vignette("fledge")` usage section).

These habits are worth learning!
