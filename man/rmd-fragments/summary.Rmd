What you need to do in practice is:

- For important commit messages you want recorded in the changelog, you can

    - Use the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) syntax. For instance `feat: Enhanced support for time series`.

     - Add a hyphen `-` or `*` at the beginning of the commit message.  Exclude housekeeping parts of the message by typing them after a line `---`.
    
    ```text
    
    - Add support for bla databases.
    
    ```
    
    or 
    
    ```text
    
    - Add support for bla databases.
    
    ---
    
    Also tweak the CI workflow accordingly. :sweat_smile:
    
    ```
    
    - (GitHub repositories only) For merge commits with the default message ("Merge pull request..."), rely on fledge's querying GitHub API to get the PR title and include it in the changelog.

For informative commit messages refer to the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html).

- Run `fledge::bump_version()` regularly e.g. before every coffee break or at the end of the day or of the week. If you forgot to merge one PR run `fledge::unbump_version()`, merge the PR with an informative squash commit message, then run `fledge::bump_version()` and go drink that coffee!

- Run `fledge::finalize_version()` if you need to edit `NEWS.md` manually e.g. if you made a typo or are not happy with a phrasing in retrospect. Even if you edit a lot, what's been written in by fledge is still a good place-holder.

- Follow the recommended steps at release (see `vignette("fledge")` usage section).

These habits are worth learning!
