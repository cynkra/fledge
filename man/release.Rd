\description{
\code{plan_release()} is run
when a milestone in the development of a package is reached
and it is ready to be sent to CRAN.

\code{release()} sends to CRAN after performing several checks,
and offers help with accepting the submission.

\code{post_release()} should be called after the submission has been accepted.
}
\details{
\code{plan_release()}:
\itemize{
\item Ensures that no modified files are in the Git index.
\item Creates a pre-release or release branch and bumps the version accordingly.
\item Writes/updates \code{cran-comments.md} with useful information about the current
release process.
\item Runs \code{urlchecker::url_update()}, \code{devtools::check_win_devel()},
and \code{rhub::rhub_check(platforms = rhub::rhub_platforms()$name)}
in the background of the RStudio IDE, or prompts the user to do so.
\item Opens a pull request for the release branch for final checks.
