\description{
\code{init_release()} and \code{pre_release()} are run
when a milestone in the development of a package is reached
and it is ready to be sent to CRAN.

\code{release()} sends to CRAN after performing several checks,
and offers help with accepting the submission.

\code{post_release()} should be called after the submission has been accepted.
}
\details{
\code{init_release()}:

release process.
\item Prompts the user to run \code{urlchecker::url_update()}, \code{devtools::check_win_devel()},
